# PyBank-PyPoll-Challenge

### PyBank

This challenge revolves around the idea of creating a Python 3 script for analyzing the financial records of your company. Given a financial dataset, we're to create a Python 3 script to analyze it (WITHOUT the help of analytical libraries, i.e. Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, etc...).

Script must analyze: 
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period.
- Calculate the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
